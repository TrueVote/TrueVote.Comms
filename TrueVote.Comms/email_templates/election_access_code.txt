<div>1. Launch our web App here. This link includes your EAC:&nbsp;<a href="https://app.truevote.org/ballot/{{ELECTIONID}}/{{EAC}}" spellcheck="false">https://app.truevote.org/ballot/{{ELECTIONID}}/{{EAC}}</a> 
</div>

    <div>Your ballot will be cryptographically secured and timestamped on the Bitcoin blockchain, just like all future TrueVote elections. While this is a mock election, the underlying technology is very real. We share details in our blog post:&nbsp;<a href="https://truevote.medium.com/truevote-private-alpha-participate-in-the-2024-election-simulation-b3ebdb7cff27" spellcheck="false">https://truevote.medium.com/truevote-private-alpha-participate-in-the-2024-election-simulation-b3ebdb7cff27</a>
